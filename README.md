### Neetcode Machine Learning Practice Solutions


I have spent good time trying to solve the neetcode.io's machine learning questions which I found extremely helpful to remember/understand/learn the foundations of today's machine learning. 
I tried not to use any LLM and tried to just answer the questions in the simplest way possible without caring about the optimization and code quality.
Here I share the solutions (all are accepted solutions) with the people in the field.

## Question 1- Gradient Descent:
## Gradient Descent Minimization

Your task is to minimize the function via Gradient Descent:

**f(x) = x²**

Gradient Descent is an optimization technique widely used in machine learning for training models. It is crucial for minimizing the cost or loss function and finding the optimal parameters of a model.

For the above function, the minimizer is clearly:

**x = 0**

However, you must implement an **iterative approximation algorithm** using **gradient descent**.

### Input Parameters

- **`iterations`**: The number of iterations to perform gradient descent. `iterations >= 0`.
- **`learning_rate`**: The learning rate for gradient descent. `0 < learning_rate < 1`.
- **`init`**: The initial guess for the minimizer. `init != 0`.

### Output

Return the value of `x` that minimizes the function using the given parameters.

> ⚠️ Round your final result to **5 decimal places** using Python's built-in `round()` function.
